I did research on navbars and how they work to get a better understanding than I currently have and decided to implement a logo in my nav bar.

I remember seeing some text that looked like it was "typed" in the browser. I researched it and found "setTimeout" helps with making text look typed.

While looking for images to put for background experience i found a css library "devicon", which has almost all the icons for devs. Ended up using it.

As i was doing this I was trying to find how to do small things like display a gif, i found a lot of cool things i want to try to add. CSS Animations look cool.

There is so much I wish I could have done, but I was so busy. I didn't have time. I wanted to do CSS animations, I wanted to fetch data from external sources using API.

I wanted to add more buttons and interactivity. I am not satisfied with the end result but the end result meets the requirements of the project.

Most of the issues I faced with formatting issues and CSS stuff. I wanted things to look a specific way but it was sometimes hard to get them to look exactly how I wanted.

I used the background color #badeed for this project because... i am badeed
