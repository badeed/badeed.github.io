## Development journal

I did research on navbars and how they work to get a better understanding than i currently have and decided to implement a logo in my nav bar.

I remember seeing some text look like it was "typed" in the browser researched it and found "setTimeout" help with making text look typed.

While looking for images to put for background experince i found a css library "devicon", which has almost all the icons for devs. Ended up using it.

As i was doing this i trying to find how to do small things like display a gif, i found a lot of cool things i want to try to add. CSS Animations look cool.

There is so much i wish i could have done, but i was so busy. I didnt have time. I wanted to do CSS animations, i wanted to fetch data from exernals soruces using API.

I wanted to add more buttons and interactivity, i am not satisified with the end result but the end result meet the requirments of the project.

Most of the issues i faced with formatting issues and CSS stuff. I wanted things to look a specific way but it was sometimes hard to get them to look exactly how i wanted.

I used the background color #badeed for this project because... i am badeed
